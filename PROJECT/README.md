## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

I am High School Student in an International School in Japan who attends an English Literature class. The class requires active discussion and exchange of ideas about the books read for the course. I am asked to manually create a personal portfolio and add my thoughts in it after the discussions in class, however at the moment this method has become too time consuming for me, tedious and hard to keep track off. It is also difficult for me to find important information when studying and is hard to catch up when I miss a class. Additionally, I have spoken with my classmates which have agreed about it being an issue for most students in the class and including motivation as one of their issues too. After a brainstorm session (shown in Appendix section 1), I've concluded that I am in need of a Social Network that allows me to post my ideas and have class discussion in an organized manner. Additionally, it is important to consider that the client's budget is limited.

## Rationale for Proposed Solution
  
Considering the clients requirements an adequate solution includes a Social Network that allows to post ideas and have class discussion in an organized manner. For this application it may adequate to consider a properly styled and formated website that can receieve data from the users and store it into databases. Considering the budgetary constrains of the client, the software tools that I propose for this solution are SQLite, Flask, HTML, CSS and Python. This tools will complement each other to fulfill the success criteria set by the client. Firstly, Flask is a web development framework that we will use to create and host the server for the Book Review webiste and allow us to use Python, HTML and CSS altogether. Secondly, I will be using the software tool Python 3.10.7. Python is free and platform-independent. That is, if you write the code on one of the Windows, Mac, or Linux operating systems, then you can run the same code on the other OS with no need for any changes so it can be run. Nevertheless, requieres a lot of memory[^1]. Thirdly, I will be using CSS which stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is a design language that makes a website look more appealing than just plain or uninspiring pieces of text [^2]. Considering the use of CSS might be relevant for the user as she wants to share her ideas in an organized manner and CSS allows to style the page for a more clean look. Lastly, we will be considering the use of HTML when buiding the Social Network. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes [^3]. Considering the use of HTML might be relevant for the user has she want a space to share ideas, where users will be posting about the books read in class. HTML will help layout all of the information shared in the Social Network. Lastly, SQLite is 
  
## Design statement

I will design and make a Book Review Social Network called LitPals for a highschool student. LitPals will be about creating a discussed-based Social Network for her English class and will be constructed using the software Python 3.10.7, Flask, HTML, SQLite and CSS. It will take about 3 weeks to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria below.

## Success criteria
  
1. Litpals displays the posts organized by book from the class reading list. [issue: "...tedious and hard to keep track off..."]
2. Litpals allows the user to create a post for every book in the class reading list. [issue: "...requires active discussion and exchange of ideas about the books read for the course..."]
3. Litpals provides a profile with a section to see the user's information and see all posts made by the user. [issue:　"...difficult for me to find important information when studying..."]
4. Litpals provides some statistics to display the top 3 commenters in LitPals [issue: "...motivation as one of their issues too..."]
5. Litpals provides a search bar to identify keywords within a book discussion. [issue: "...hard to keep track off..."]
6. Litpals displays the date a post was made. [issue: "...hard to catch up when I miss a class..."]
