## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

I am High School Student in an International School in Japan. The school offers different levels and types of English classes from which I am currently attending to the English A Literature class. The class requires active discussion for each class where we share our thoughts about the books read for the course. I am asked to manually create a personal portafolio and add my thoughts in it after the discussions in class, however at the moment this method has become too time consuming for me and tedious to mantain organized. It is also difficult for me to catch up later when missing one class as the discussion is not recorded in any way. Additionally, I have spoken with my classmates which have agreed as it beign an issue for most students in the class. After a brainstorm session (shown in Appendix section 1), I have concluded that I am in need of a Social Network that allows me to post my ideas and have class discussion in an organized manner in a shared portafolio space. Additionally, it is important to consider that the client's budget is limited.


## Rationale for Proposed Solution
  
Considering teh clients requirements an adequate solution includes a Social Network that allows to post ideas and have class discussion in an organized manner in a shared portafolio space. For this application it may adequate to consider a website with a GUI (Graphical User Interface) that can store data into a database. Considering the budgetary constrains of the client, the software tools that I propose for this solution are Flask, HTML, CSS and Python. This tools will complement each other to fulfill the success criteria set by the client. Firstly, Flask is a web development framework that we will use to create and host the server for the Book Review webiste and allow us to use Python, HTML and CSS altogether. Secondly, I will be using the software tool Python 3.10.7. Python is free and platform-independent. That is, if you write the code on one of the Windows, Mac, or Linux operating systems, then you can run the same code on the other OS with no need for any changes so it can be run. In other words, it can be supported by multiple platforms. Nevertheless, requieres a lot of memeory[^1]. Thirdly, I will be using CSS
  

  
  


## Design statement

I will design and create a Book Review Social Network for a highschool student. The project will be about designing a Social Network that helps her post her ideas and have class discussion about the books read in class and will be constructed using the software Python 3.10.7, Flask, HTML and CSS. It will take about 3 weeks to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria below.

## Success criteria
  
1. The solution provides a search bar to identify keywords within a discussion.
2. The solution provides a way to save favorite comments.
3. The solution displays the discussions organized by book from the class reading list in an organized manner.
4. The solution allows the user to start new discussions for every book in the class reading list. 
5. The solution allows the user to post ideas within a discussion.
6. The solution allows the user to comment on previously posted ideas within a discussion.
