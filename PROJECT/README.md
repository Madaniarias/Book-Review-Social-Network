## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

A highschool student, Lison Hebert, is interested in building good habits to improve her daily rutine and help her reach your goals. She has been manually keeping track of her habit completion in a personal diary, however at the moment this method has become too time consuming and tedious to keep track off. It is also difficult for the highschool student to see the progresss in an organized manner. The client is in need of a habit tracker application that helps her visualize, organize and keep track of her progress in the course of developing good habits. Additional, it si important to consider that the client's budget is limited.

## Rationale for Proposed Solution

Considering the client requirements an adequate solution includes a habit tracker application that helps her visualize, organize and keep track of her progress in the course of developing good habits. For this application it may adequate to consider a computer program with a GUI (Graphical User Interface) that can store data into a database. Considering the budgetary constrains of the client, the software tool that I proposed for this solution is Python. Python is free and platform-independent. That is, if you write the code on one of the Windows, Mac, or Linux operating systems, then you can run the same code on the other OS with no need for any changes so it can be run. In other words, it can be supported by multiple platforms. Nevertheless, requieres a lot of memeory[^1]. Regarding data storage for this solution, SQLite can be a good option. SQLite is the most used database engine in the world. SQLite is built into all mobile phones and most computers and comes bundled inside countless other applications that people use every day. The code for SQLite is in the public domain and is thus free for use for any purpose, commercial or private[^2]. A database engine is the software that does the real work of sorting the information, finding specific data that you request, and so on [^3]. This makes it a good option for the proposed solution as the habit tracker will be displaying, storing and deleting data regarding th habits of the client. As for the GUI (Graphical User Interface), KivyMD is good option to consider. A graphical user interface (GUI) is an interface through which a user interacts with electronic devices such as computers and smartphones through the use of icons, menus and other visual indicators or representations (graphics) [^4]. This GUI tool is very simple and allows to create the displays required by the proposed solution.

## Design statement

I will design and make a habit tracker application for a highschool student. The project will be about designing that helps her visualize, organize and keep track of her progress in the course of developing good habits and will be constructed using the software Python 3.10.7, SQLite (database engine) and KivyMD (Graphical User Interface tool). It will take about 4 weeks to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria below.
